            <img src="images/blog1ai.webp" class="imgblog1">
            <p>AI adoption is on the rise with top use cases being medical image analysis and drug discovery.<br>
            Health care spending on AI software is expected to grow 40% in 2023, from $4.4 billion in 2022 to 
                nearly $6.2 billion in the new year, according to Omdia forecasts.<br>
            “Health care is going to grow faster than most other industries, and according to our forecasts, 
            we expect spending on AI in the health care sector to be ranked second only to consumers in 2027,” 
            said Brosnan, who is in Omdia’s AI & Intelligent Automation Practice.<br><br>
        

        
            Health care has lagged behind other industries in AI adoption. While 25% of all industries have scaled 
            AI deployments across multiple business units or functions, 
                only 19% have done so in health care, according to an Omdia survey in 2022.

                But that is rapidly changing. AI has proven to be effective in health care, which is prompting 
                the growth in usage, he said. For example, AI was used during the pandemic − assisting health care 
                providers with COVID-19 diagnoses, patient prognosis and helping researchers understand 
                the variations in the spike protein.<br><br>
                
                “The use of AI during the pandemic and proof-of-concept projects is bolstering confidence in the 
                value AI can deliver in health care,” Brosnan said.<br><br>
                
                In fact, 96% of health care organizations surveyed by Omdia in 2022 said they are confident or very 
                confident that AI will deliver positive results, and 67% surveyed said AI’s ability to add value 
                had increased over the past year.<br><br>
                
                That will translate into massive investments into AI. According to Omdia, spending on AI software 
                will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% and reach $13.8 billion in spending in 2027, 
                tied for the fastest growing sector.<br><br>
                Emerging technology to better train health care AI models

                Federated learning or swarm learning, an emerging technology that will enable health care providers to securely use patient 
                data to better train AI models, will gain bigger traction in 2023, Brosnan said.<br><br>
                
                To reduce bias, it is important to train AI models against a large dataset. 
                But to do so, many health care institutions would like to share data, so they can build a more 
                comprehensive dataset to use to train an AI model.<br><br>
                
                Traditionally, they would have to move the data to one central repository. However, with federated or 
                swarm learning, the data does not have to move. Instead, the AI model goes to each individual health 
                care facility and trains on the data, he said. This way, health care providers can maintain security 
                and governance over their data.<br><br>
                
                “With federated or swarm learning, the data does not have to leave the source institution, but the 
                AI model moves to the data,” Brosnan said. Federated learning uses a centralized orchestrator, while 
                swarm learning is more distributed and does not use a centralized orchestrator.<br><br>
                
                The technology is currently undergoing proofs-of-concept. In 2021, Sanofi, a large pharmaceutical 
                company, invested $180 million in a federated learning company that specializes 
                in health care.

    <h1>How Data Governance is Central to Effective Data Analytics</h1>

    <hr>
    <h6><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>  November 21, 2022</h6>
    <h6><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>  7 min read</h6>
      
        <img src="images/blog22ai.webp" class="imgblog1">  
        <p>In the publishing industry, there are a lot of things we can measure. 
            However, if there is no strategy underlining how and why we collect data and who can access it, 
            the value is lost. <br>
            Not only that, but we can put our business at serious risk of non-compliance.<br>
            Ultimately, data governance is central to effective data analytics and underpins everything we do.<br><br>
            
            When it comes to data, the first question isn’t whether you can measure something; it’s whether you should. 
            It’s vital to ask yourself what your business model is. After all, it takes money to create content. There is a big 
            debate in many publishing houses as to whether people should be allowed to access 
            data if they don’t accept cookies.<br> 
            If you can’t measure what those consumers are doing and why, then do they still provide business value? If not, 
            the business model needs to change. A lot of companies are trying to navigate the same landscape and there isn’t 
            a single standard on what you should do. Ultimately, while respecting regulations and people’s right to privacy, 
            you need to consider the business value of data. In our industry, sometimes content is given away for free and money made 
            through advertising and at other times, content is subscription-based; what is true in both instances is that data governance 
            informs that choice.<br><br>

            What you can measure or should measure hugely impacts what you can do as a business and can create a significant shift in your 
            business model. 
            Ultimately, you can’t run a business if you’re not sure about what you can measure and what the regulations are in terms of data 
            governance. That’s why I’m such a huge advocate of data governance having a seat at the table with top company executives; 
            it has to underpin the business model and business strategy.<br><br>
          
            There have been a lot of changes in recent years from a privacy perspective, with GDPR and other regulations coming into force. 
            To be compliant, every business needs to be aware of what data they measure and store and who has access to it. 
            Data governance is there to ensure people only have access to the right thing, with the right controls in place to prevent any violations of that. 
            It’s vital to ensure people’s privacy and data are protected, with no chance of it being misused. After all, getting it wrong has serious legal, 
            financial, and reputational implications for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.<br><br>

            To be able to manage the legal aspects of external data governance, having a strong legal team is fundamental. 
            Having a data privacy group within your legal team can help you really understand risk and interpret what the law means for your business. 
            It’s no mean feat, of course. There is no one regulating body and the rules from one country to the next can vary greatly. 
            It’s extremely complex to navigate, which makes having data privacy experts on hand, and a legal counsel in particular, invaluable.<br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, internal data and accessibility need to sit as a data function within the technology team. There has to be a specific group, 
            a data team, that ensures a business collects, surfaces, and stores the right information and makes it accessible. Only then can 
            a data analyst or data scientist interpret that information and create business value.<br><br>
      
            Data governance needs to continually evolve to account for regulatory changes and new opportunities. Generally, it’s easy to interpret the data compliance landscape and which way it’s heading. 
            It focuses on the basic need for people’s human rights. With that in mind, businesses need to consider what the future looks like, 
            create a multi-year plan, and shore up their defenses.<br><br>

            The other thing that every business needs to account for is the volume and type of data that will become available. 
            The number of platforms that businesses use to reach their consumers has increased exponentially and that trend looks set to continue. 
            Each platform is governed by specific regulations. Privacy is complicated and it’s about to become a lot more complicated with the increase 
            of virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the advent of the metaverse. Data security will continue to form an essential part of 
            the data governance journey.
